3. **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines:**

   - In `.github/workflows/`, create workflows for:
     - Building and testing the application on push.
     - Deploying to AWS on merge to `main` branch.
   - Use GitHub Actions to automate these workflows.

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - Store sensitive data using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.

5. **Set Up Monitoring and Logging:**

   - Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring application logs and metrics.
   - Set up alerts for critical issues.

6. **Update Documentation:**

   - Provide instructions on how to deploy and manage the application.

### Files to Create or Modify

- `Dockerfile` (backend and frontend)
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- Deployment scripts or configurations
- Update `README.md` with deployment instructions

### Testing Instructions

- Deploy the application to AWS.
- Verify that both frontend and backend are accessible and functioning.
- Test the CI/CD pipeline by pushing changes and ensuring they are deployed.
- Check monitoring dashboards for logs and metrics.

## Phase 14: Documentation

### Objectives

- Complete project documentation.
- Generate API documentation with Swagger.
- Provide user manuals and developer guides.

### Steps

1. **API Documentation:**

   - Install Swagger UI for the backend:
     ```bash
     npm install swagger-ui-express swagger-jsdoc
     ```
   - In `backend/src/docs/swagger.js`, set up Swagger definitions.
   - Document all API endpoints with proper annotations.
   - Serve Swagger UI at an endpoint like `/api/docs`.

2. **Update `README.md` Files:**

   - Provide detailed project descriptions.
   - Include instructions for setup, testing, and deployment.

3. **User Manuals:**

   - In `docs/`, create `UserManual.md` for end-users.
   - Include screenshots and instructions for using the application.

4. **Developer Guides:**

   - In `docs/`, create `DeveloperGuide.md` with:
     - Architecture overview.
     - Coding standards.
     - Contribution guidelines.

5. **UI Mockups:**

   - Update `docs/UI_Mockups/` with final screenshots or updated mockups.

6. **License and Contribution Guidelines:**

   - Add a `LICENSE` file if applicable.
   - Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines for contributing to the project.

### Files to Create or Modify

- `backend/src/docs/swagger.js`
- `backend/package.json` (add Swagger dependencies)
- `backend/src/app.js` (serve Swagger UI)
- `README.md` (root and within `backend/` and `frontend/`)
- `docs/API.md` (if not generated via Swagger)
- `docs/UserManual.md`
- `docs/DeveloperGuide.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Testing Instructions

- Access the API documentation via the Swagger UI endpoint.
- Review all documentation files for completeness and accuracy.
- Ensure that all instructions are clear and that any external links work.

## Conclusion

By following this phased approach, the development process is broken down into manageable tasks. Each phase builds upon the previous ones, ensuring a coherent and fully functional application upon completion. Testing and documentation are integral parts of each phase, promoting code quality and maintainability.
